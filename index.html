           Hi everyone! This is just a page to share with you beyond the realms of social networks what I like and what I am currently doing in my student life!! Below, you'll find the link to the company where I will be doing my first internship as part of my curriculum at ESSEC Business School.

       <h3>Sports</h3>
          <p>
            I used to play golf at the international level during high school, but I had to stop because of my studies. Now, I go to the gym four times a week because it helps me feel better.

        <h3>Working on my personnal project: entrepreneurship</h3>
        <p>
          I use to work on entrepreneurial projects, because I love it and I want to be an entrepreneur after graduation.

          <h3>Spend time with my friends</h3>
          <p>
            I would lie if I told you that as a French student in a business school, I do not spend time with my friends... But I think that it is also important to keep a certain balance of social connections even if we work a lot.
